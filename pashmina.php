						<span style="color:#602D8D;">Pashmina is the finest type of cashmere wool. The textiles made from it were first woven in Kashmir, India. The name comes from Persian:  pashmina, meaning "made from wool" and literally translates to "Soft Gold" in Kashmiri.The wool comes from three breeds of the Pashmina goat; namely the Changthangi or Kashmir Pashmina goat, the Chegu, and Chyangara or Nepalese Pashmina goat. Pashmina shawls are hand spun, and woven in Indian Kashmir and Nepal, and made from fine cashmere fibre.<br />Cashmere shawls have been manufactured in Nepal and Kashmir for thousands of years. The test for a quality pashmina is warmth and feel. Pashmina and Cashmere are derived from the "capra hircus" mountain goat. One distinct difference between Pashmina and generic Cashmere is the fibre diameter. Pashmina fibres are finer and thinner (12-13.5 microns) than generic cashmere fibre (15-19 microns) and therefore, ideal for making light weight apparel like fine scarves.<br /><br /> Today, however, the word "Pashmina" has been used too liberally and many scarves made from natural or synthetic fiber are sold as Pashmina creating confusion in the market.[citation needed]. The exorbitant price of a Pashmina shawl is due to the quantum of expert craftsmanship that goes into creating each shawl and the rarity of the Pashmina wool - the wool is used in an authentic Kashmiri Pashmina comes from the Changpa breed of the capra hircus goat and this breed constitutes less than 0.1% of global Cashmere production.<br />

As the fibre diameter is very low, Pashmina has to be hand-processed and woven into products such as shawls, scarves, wraps, throws, stoles, etc. Pashmina is the name given to it as Persians came to Kashmir via the routes of Drass Ladakh, and found it very soft and tough in quality.[citation needed] Pashmina is the Persian word "pashm" meaning wool. However, the quality of a finished shawl is not solely dependent on the fibre diameter of the wool but also on the craftsmen's skills. Pashmina products are made only in Kashmir and more recently in Nepal where the industry has seen a surge in production.</span>
