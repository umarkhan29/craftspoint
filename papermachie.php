						<span style="color:#602D8D;">In Persia and Kashmir, papier-mache has been used to manufacture small painted boxes, trays and cases. Japan and China also produced laminated paper articles using papier-mache. In Japan and India, papier-mache was used to add decorative elements to armor and shields.<br />Starting around 1725 in Europe, gilded papier-mache began to appear as a low-cost alternative to similarly treated plaster or carved wood in architecture.<br />Henry Clay of Birmingham, England, patented a process for treating laminated sheets of paper with linseed oil to produce waterproof panels in 1772.<br />These sheets were used for building coach door panels, amongst other structural uses. Theodore Jennens patented a process in 1847 for steaming and pressing these laminated sheets into various shapes, which were then used to manufacture trays, chair backs, and structural panels, usually laid over a wood or metal armature for strength. The papier-mache was smoothed and lacquered, or finished with a pearl shell finish. The industry lasted through the 19th century.<br /><br />Russia had a thriving industry in ornamental papier-mache. A large assortment of painted Russian papier-mache items appear in a Tiffany & Co. catalog from 1893. Martin Travers the English ecclesiastical designer made much use of papier mache for his church furnishings in the 1930s.
Papier-mache has been used for doll heads starting as early as 1540, molded in two parts from a mixture of paper pulp, clay, and plaster, and then glued together, with the head then smoothed, painted and varnished.</span>
